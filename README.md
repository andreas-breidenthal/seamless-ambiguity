*Two interconnected manuscripts exploring the boundary between fictional archives and historical record.*

# Seamless: A Study in Ambiguity

## Overview

This repository presents two interconnected manuscripts published in the public domain.

Read together, they explore the unstable boundary between:
- fictional archives and recorded history  
- historical silence and narrative invention  
- documentation, authority, and belief  

The documents are complete as presented. No further context is required.

## Contents

### [Operation Seamless:](operation-seamless.md) A Recovered Archive
A collection of purported late-Victorian documents describing a violent incident in 1888 and the subsequent erasure of its participants from the historical record.

### [Repairing the Gaps](reparing-the-gaps.md)
A reflective companion text examining the construction of *Operation Seamless* as a fictional archive — its research, structure, ethical constraints, and deliberate ambiguities.

## Reading Order

The documents may be read independently.

However, the intended sequence is:
1. *Operation Seamless: A Recovered Archive*
2. *Repairing the Gaps*

## Status

This work is complete.

No revisions, expansions, or clarifications are planned.
